\section{Contribution}

This projects provides two main boiler plate for developers. 
Firstly well documented and tested robot gripper environment based on Open AI Gym interface\cite{openai gym}. 
Gym Environment provides easy to use interface to interact. Moreover, gripper environment complies with the
most standard and well documented libraries such as python3, pybullet and numpy. Secondly, we present a novel implementation of BDQ reinforcement algorithm algorihtm
adopted to most used Stable Baselines project\cite{stable-baselines}.
