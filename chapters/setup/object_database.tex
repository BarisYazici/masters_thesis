\section{Object Database}

Naturally, the usage of particular object shapes and colors brings a certain bias to the learned grasp model. Therefore, the object database should be as diverse as possible to encourage the model to perform well on novel objects. Indeed, the generalization of all different shapes and colors of the objects is our primary concern. Since we measure the success rate of a model on the test set, a model that overfits the training dataset would perform poorly on the test set.

We use the random object database from pybullet-data\footnote{\url{https://bit.ly/3ijyCJM}} for our experiments. Unlike Breyer et al. and Quillen et al., we divided our dataset into training, test, and validation datasets. Prior works divided the dataset only into test and training. We believe the inclusion of the validation set contributes to the generalization of the trained model. Test and validation sets have 150 objects each, and training sets consist of 700 objects.
