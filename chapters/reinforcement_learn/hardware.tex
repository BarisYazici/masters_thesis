\section{Hardware Setup}

Reinforcement learning in coordination with neural networks use huge computational resources. As of today, GPUs are the most common and efficient way to train neural networks. As shown in the figure \ref{fig:cpuvsgpu}, GPUs are 11-fold faster than the CPU neural network computation \cite{Schlegel2015}. Thus, a current GPU can decrease the learning time 11 times shorter than a CPU.

For the duration of the thesis we gradually increase our access to larger learning resources. In the beginning of the project, we used our lab computer at Human-Brain-Project Lab that only had a Nvidia GeForce GTX-670, 31.2gb Ram. Since, we did not need much computational resources in the beginning, GeForce GT-670 with 4gb ram was enough for us. As the computational requirements got higher, we migrated to use google cloud services. We received free google cloud credits from Roboy\footnote{\url{https://roboy.org/}} only for 2 months of usage. Enabling us to train larger networks in parallel with a more contemporary graphics card Nvidia Tesla V100\footnote{\url{https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/}}. Tesla V100 is designed for the AI research, thus it is more optimized compare to the GeForce series in terms of neural network training. After the free usage period had ended, we switched to LRZ cloud framework. At LRZ, we continued to have a Tesla V100 with 368gb and 20VCPUs. 

The increase in the compute capability delivered a faster physics simulation. In return the total training time got faster. Apart from the computational capacities, among the three different platform LRZ provided the fastest internet connection. Having their server center at Garching, there was no recognizable latency. Although google cloud platform servers are located in Frankurt, we suffered with laggy internet connection. 
Overall LRZ cloud computation framework provides a safe and fast connection. Moreover, we received quick response to our questions regarding the framework usage.

Remote desktop connection was necessary tool for our project. Given that, we trained neural network completely on the cloud., we needed a way to visualize the trained agents. Obviously, copying the trained model file back to the local computer is an option. But even though, PyBullet support MacOS, the forward pass of the neural network still takes long on consumer hardware. For those reasons we needed to use remote desktop connections. We tested two different remote desktop software: VNCViewer, and Tiger Remote Desktop. Tiger remote desktop has an edge over VNCViewer in terms of lightweight and user-friendly design. Besides, we often experienced blurred view and unable to change the screen resolution on VNCViewer. We installed the Xfce\footnote{\url{https://www.xfce.org/}} unix bsed desktop environment on LRZ cloud machine and forward the VNC port to localhost to connect with Tiger Remote Desktop. Xfce delivers a lightweight, easy-to-use dektop environment. We were overall satisfied with the performance of the remote desktop environment.
