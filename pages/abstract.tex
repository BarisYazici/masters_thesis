%TODO: Abstract

Grasping of an object is the most integral behavior for robotics manipulators. Every manipulation task starts with a grasping procedure. A firm grasp will be a must for service and industrial robots of the future. The only way we can achieve a trustworthy grasp and manipulation is to let the robotic manipulators learn by themselves. To this end, we successfully delivered a learning-based grasping policy by combining curriculum learning with action-branching DQN in the reinforcement learning framework.
Moreover, the robustness of the trained models is tested in new scenes and with novel objects. We evaluated three algorithms: BDQ, DQN, and SAC. SAC delivered a robust grasp policy only after 2 hours of training in simulation. This model performed 100\% on the test data, and 97\% on the wooden blocks set, an entirely new set of objects.
