%TODO: Acknowledgments
I want to thank:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Mahmoud Akl for allowing me to pursue my thesis in this area, for being there whenever I need him, even during his vacation, and for his wise advice.
    \item Michel Breyer for sharing his invaluable insights in robotics.
    \item My mom, my father, and my sister for their constant love and support throughout my master's degree
    \item My friends at Biederstein, for encouraging me in every phase of my master's thesis.
\end{enumerate}
